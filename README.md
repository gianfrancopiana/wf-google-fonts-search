# Google Fonts Search for Webflow â€” Chrome Extension

![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/gianfrancopiana/wf-google-fonts-search)

This Chrome extension aims to help [Webflow](https://webflow.com/) users add Google fonts to their projects. It replaces Webflow's dropdown list under Project settings.

## ðŸ“š About

[Webflow](https://webflow.com/) is known for its ease of use and simplicity. But I found myself a bit overwhelmed when adding Google fonts.

Currently, the way to add a font is to select it from a standard [dropdown list](https://university.webflow.com/article/google-fonts). But there are more than 900 fonts to choose from!

So I decided to create an alternative that would make adding fonts more simple.

## âœ¨ Features

* Built-in search functionality with autocomplete behavior
* Built-in keyboard navigation using arrow keys
* Prevents duplicate font entries on projects
* Changes the `Add Font` button label to match the selected font; e.g. `Add Roboto`.
* Follows [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#combobox)
